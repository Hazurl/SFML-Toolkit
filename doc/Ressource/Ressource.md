# Ressource

This system is a simple one with objective to load and unload a ressource when needed.
It has the advantage of reducing the memory used, but you don't control when the object get loaded which could happen in the middle of your application resulting in a "freeze".

**Summary**
- [Ressource](https://github.com/Hazurl/SFML-Toolkit/blob/master/doc/Ressource/Ressource.md#ressource)
- [Loader](https://github.com/Hazurl/SFML-Toolkit/blob/master/doc/Ressource/Ressource.md#loader)
- [Example](https://github.com/Hazurl/SFML-Toolkit/blob/master/doc/Ressource/Ressource.md#example)

## Ressource

`sftk::Ressource<T>` is a class that will distribute the ressource's handler, it hold a [loader](https://github.com/Hazurl/SFML-Toolkit/blob/master/doc/Ressource/Ressource.md#loader). 

You can check if the ressource is loaded with `sf::Ressource<T>::is_loaded` or by casting it to a boolean.
You can also get the number of handler still alive with `sf::Ressource<T>::use_count`.
Finally and not least, you can acquire a handler to the ressource with `sf::Ressource<T>::get`, it returns a shared_ptr, if the object failed to load, it returns a null shared pointer.

Handlers returned by `sf::Ressource<T>::get` will increment the reference counter of the ressource, when it goes out of scope it decrement the counter, if it reach 0, the ressource is destroyed. 

> *Note:*
> if  sf::Ressource<T>` goes out of scope the underlying ressource is not clean up, it will wait that all handlers get destroyed.

> *Note:*
> You can consult the handler's doc [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr)

## Loader

Loaders are very simple, they are just invocable object that takes a reference to the ressource, load it and returns a boolean for the success/failure.
Two functions let's you help you to create those loader `sftk::load_from_file` which will create a loader that use `T::loadFromFile`; and `sftk::backup`, a compositor, if the first loader fail it runs the second one.

```cpp
template<typename T>
using Loader = std::function<bool(T&)>;
```

## Example

[Source](https://github.com/Hazurl/SFML-Toolkit/blob/master/src/example/ressource.cpp)

```cpp
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

#include <sftk/ressource/Ressource.hpp>

int main() {
    auto load = sftk::backup( // backup execute the first loader, if it fail it execute the second one
        sftk::load_from_file<sf::Texture>("non_existing_file.wtf"),
        sftk::load_from_file<sf::Texture>("/a/path/to/a/valid/texture.png")
    );

    sftk::Ressource<sf::Texture> res(load);
    sf::Sprite s;
    auto t_ = res.get(); // if you delete this line, the texture will bed destroyed since the only reference to it will go out of scope
    // in order to not run into this behaviour, if you use a sprite (that need a reference to the texture), 
    // you must keep the handler returned by sftk::Ressource<T>::get
    {
        auto t = res.get();
        s.setTexture(*t);
    } // `t` goes out of scope, it it's the only handler on this ressource, it will unload it 

    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(800, 600), "SFML Window");
    while (window.isOpen()) {
        sf::Event event;
        while (window.pollEvent(event))
            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
                window.close();
        window.clear();
        window.draw(s);
        window.display();
    }

}
```
